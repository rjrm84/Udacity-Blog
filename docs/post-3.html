<p>Driven by the change in human behavior worldwide, having a mobile presence has become imperative for a business’s survival. As mobility continues to transform industries globally, mobile-first companies are capturing the imagination of the ever-increasing mobile society.

    However, merely breaking into the mobile market does not necessarily translate into success for a business. To succeed in a highly competitive mobile marketplace, it takes in-depth research, strategy building, extensive planning, and assessing the current mobile ecosystem for enterprises with either an existing mobile app or those planning to build a new mobile application.

    Although native apps offer an unmatched experience in terms of aesthetics and functionality, native apps are costly to build and maintain. The diversity of devices and platforms makes maximum user penetration challenging with native apps. The solution lies in creating a web, hybrid, or cross-platform mobile app for businesses with budget constraints by leveraging mobile app development frameworks.

    Modern mobile app development frameworks offer many in-built advantages, such as a quick development process, efficiency, full-proof environment, etc. The framework renders the app for the desired platform with the developer’s code using pre-built components such as compilers, debuggers, toolsets, coding interfaces, etc.</p>

    <p>The App Annie State of Mobile 2021 report informs that Generation Z, Millenials, and Baby Boomers spend 16%, 18%, and 30% more time year-on-year, respectively, on their favorite apps. Post the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, mobile adoption witnessed a boom in 2020, advancing by 2-3 years in 12 months. For the first time, mobile time spent surpassed TV. While the average American spent 3.7 hours watching TV a day, they spent 4 hours a day on their mobile device in H2 2020.

    According to a report from Statista, as 2021 dawned upon us, the number of global mobile users crossed the 7 billion mark. In the new reality, Digital Transformation has assumed greater significance. The users have exceptionally high standards in terms of functionality and performance when it comes to mobile applications. Therefore, a mobile app’s success translates into adapting digital content to transcend seamlessly across varying screen sizes and a broad range of devices encompassing Android and iOS platforms.

    Obtaining the services of a reliable mobile app development company or hiring a mobile app developer on a freelance basis can enable a business to build mobile apps that are fast, responsive, and deliver exceptional user experiences. Leveraging mobile app development frameworks makes the mobile app development process efficient and fast. </p>
